        <p class="boxed">"On January 19, 2025, I had the opportunity to visit the Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum and Leslie Science & Nature Center. It was a fantastic experience filled with interactive exhibits and engaging displays. One of the highlights was a stunning image of the Earth and Moon, which I captured during my visit. The image showcased a digital representation of our planet, highlighting its diverse landscapes and geographical boundaries. The vivid colors and intricate details created a captivating view of Earth from a global perspective. It was fascinating to see how the continents and countries are interconnected, giving me a deeper appreciation for the complexity and beauty of our world."</p>
