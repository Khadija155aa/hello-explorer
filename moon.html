        <p class="boxed">"On January 19, 2025, I had the opportunity to visit the Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum and Leslie Science & Nature Center. It was a fantastic experience filled with interactive exhibits and engaging displays. One of the highlights was a stunning image of the Earth and Moon, which I captured during my visit. The image showcased a digital representation of our planet, highlighting its diverse landscapes and geographical boundaries. The vivid colors and intricate details created a captivating view of Earth from a global perspective. It was fascinating to see how the continents and countries are interconnected, giving me a deeper appreciation for the complexity and beauty of our world."</p>

        <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System. The Moon's surface is marked by craters, mountains, and flat plains known as lunar maria.</p>

        <p>The Moon's gravity causes tides in Earth's oceans, creating the rhythmic rise and fall of sea levels. It takes about 27.3 days for the Moon to orbit Earth, which is why we see different phases of the Moon.</p>
