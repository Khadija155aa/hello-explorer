        <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System. The Moon's surface is marked by craters, mountains, and flat plains known as lunar maria.</p>

        <p>The Moon's gravity causes tides in Earth's oceans, creating the rhythmic rise and fall of sea levels. It takes about 27.3 days for the Moon to orbit Earth, which is why we see different phases of the Moon.</p>
