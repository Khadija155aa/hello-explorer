        <h1>Welcome to the Moon Page</h1>

        <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System.</p>

        <p>The Moon's surface is marked by craters, mountains, and flat plains known as lunar maria.</p>

        <p class="boxed">This paragraph highlights fascinating facts about the Moon's phases and its influence on Earth's tides.</p>

        <p>The Moon's gravity causes tides in Earth's oceans, creating the rhythmic rise and fall of sea levels.</p>

        <p>It takes about 27.3 days for the Moon to orbit Earth, which is why we see different phases of the Moon.</p>
